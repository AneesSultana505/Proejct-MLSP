# Project-MLSP
Predictive Anomaly Detection in Human Vital Signs Using LSTM
for Health Risk Analysis This project combines human vital signs, sleep, and activity data for anomaly detection using LSTM Autoencoder and CNN+LSTM models. Gaussian noise enhances robustness, while feature engineering strengthens classification. A Random Forest classifier ensures accurate predictions, enabling early health risk detection and scalable wellness monitoring.
